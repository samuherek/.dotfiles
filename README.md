# Let's set up the gorgodon

You got a new macos in your hand and have to get it up and running like a champ? Let's get it going....

### Step 1
Make sure to get ready all your secrets like passwords and ssh keys if you want to load them to this machine. 

### Step 2
- Download the [`init.sh` script](https://github.com/samuherek/dev.macos-setup/blob/main/init.sh)
- Make it executable `chmod +x ${path to the init.sh}`
- Run the beast!

*NOTE:*
In case I ever get this repo public, we can make a more straightforward execution.

> All this script does is it installs homebrew, ansible, and sets up ssh keys to get the ball rolling...

### Step 3
Run the ansible palybooks....

## What this is about
